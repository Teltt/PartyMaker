# PartyMaker
This is a mario party fangame framework.

Make events, spaces or capsules by extending CapsuleBase, Space, or Event.gd and inheriting from the appropriate scene.

Features:
Built in space linker
Multiple types of turn order, including car party and active.
No minigames :( but... we allow users to input minigame results from any game

Some assets that I don't have permission to distribute may be missing from the engine. If you get an error related to this, please don't report it.
